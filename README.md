# Letter Of Offer Generator

## Overview
This application is designed to streamline the process of creating a Letter Of Offer. Its primary goal is to reduce repetitive tasks, minimize potential errors, and improve the efficiency of HR procedures.

## Features
Paragraph Tab: Allows the creation of reusable paragraphs and the inclusion of keys as placeholders.
Template Tab: Facilitates the creation and management of templates, including the ability to add paragraphs and reorder them as needed.
Form Tab: Allows the user to fill out the form with the necessary details and choose the desired template.
Getting Started
Follow these steps to use the app:

#### Paragraph Tab:
Create new paragraphs and add keys as placeholders.
#### Template Tab:
Create templates and add the desired paragraphs into the templates.<br>
Change the order of the paragraphs in a template, if necessary.
#### Form Tab:
Fill out the form and choose the template you want to use.

## Motivation
The main motivation behind creating this app was to reduce the need for manually editing text across multiple templates, thus reducing potential errors. Previously, similar paragraphs had to be edited separately in each of the 50 templates. Now, a single paragraph can be used in multiple templates and edited all at once.
